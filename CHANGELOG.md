## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-06

The library and CLI are now focused on one job: downloading a complete Costco
purchase history to local JSON files.

### Added
- **`Client.DownloadHistory(ctx, HistoryOptions)`**: Downloads every online order and warehouse receipt in a date range. The range is walked newest-first in windows small enough for Costco's API to accept, online orders are paged until exhausted, and each receipt is expanded into its full line-item detail. A failure in the newest window aborts the run (that almost always means expired tokens); later failures are collected in `History.Warnings` so one unavailable record cannot discard years of downloaded data.
- **`Client.FetchAllOnlineOrders(ctx, startDate, endDate, pageSize)`**: Pages through every online order in a date range.
- **`FileStore`**: Writes history to a directory as `orders/<order number>.json`, `receipts/<barcode>.json`, combined `orders.json` / `receipts.json`, and a `manifest.json` index. Records are written as they arrive, so an interrupted download resumes instead of starting over. Files and directories are created user-only (0600/0700) because receipts contain membership numbers and payment descriptions.
- **`SplitDateRange(since, until, windowDays)`**: Splits a date range into contiguous, non-overlapping windows, newest first.
- **`History`, `HistoryOptions`, `HistoryStore`, `Manifest`, `DateWindow`**: Supporting types for the download flow.
- **`ErrNoOrderData`**: Sentinel error letting callers distinguish "this window has no orders" from a real failure.
- **`costco-cli` download command** (now the default): `costco-cli` with no arguments downloads everything into `./costco-history`. Flags: `-out`, `-since`, `-until`, `-window`, `-page-size`, `-delay`, `-retries`, `-no-items`, `-force`, `-quiet`. Exits non-zero when any record could not be downloaded.

### Changed
- **BREAKING — CLI commands**: `-cmd orders`, `-cmd receipts` and `-cmd receipt-detail` are gone. The downloaded JSON contains the same data, and `-cmd` now defaults to `download`. `setup`, `import-token` and `info` are unchanged.
- **`GetReceipts` date handling**: Dates given as `YYYY-MM-DD` are converted to the `M/DD/YYYY` format Costco's receipt API requires, so both formats now work. Previously an ISO date was forwarded unchanged and silently returned nothing.
- **`CostcoClient` interface**: Now describes the download methods alongside the three API primitives.

### Removed
- **BREAKING — spending analytics helpers**: `GetAllTransactionItems`, `GetItemHistory`, `GetSpendingSummary` and `GetFrequentItems`, along with the `TransactionWithItems`, `ItemPurchase`, `SpendingByDepartment` and `FrequentItem` types. Each re-downloaded the whole history to compute one aggregate; the same analysis now runs offline over the downloaded JSON.

### Fixed
- **Client tests**: Several tests still built clients without tokens after password-grant authentication was removed in 0.3.11, so they failed before reaching their test server.

[1.0.0]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.11...v1.0.0

## [0.3.11] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **OAuth B2C Policy Update**: Updated token endpoint from B2C policy `201` to `209` to match Costco's current authentication setup.
- **Token Refresh**: Removed unsupported `scope` parameter from refresh token requests, which was causing `AADB2C90117` errors. The `refresh_token` grant type should only include `grant_type`, `client_id`, and `refresh_token`.
- **Password Grant Removal**: Removed password-based authentication entirely. OAuth2 password grant no longer works with Costco's current setup. Users must use token import from browser: `costco-cli -cmd import-token`.

[0.3.11]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.10...v0.3.11

## [0.3.10] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- **`NetDiscounts` word-overlap fallback**: Added a fourth matching strategy for cases where a coupon references a parent by a generic category name that shares no substring with the branded product description. For example, a coupon with `/AAA BATTERY` now correctly matches an item described as `DURACELL AAA` via the shared token `AAA`. Words shorter than 3 characters are excluded to avoid false positives. When multiple candidates share words with the coupon reference, the item with the most words in common is chosen.

[0.3.10]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.9...v0.3.10

## [0.3.9] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **`NetDiscounts(items []ReceiptItem) ([]ReceiptItem, []ReceiptItem)`**: New exported utility function that applies Costco discount line items to their parent items using a three-level matching strategy: (1) exact item-number match, (2) exact description match (case-insensitive), (3) substring/contains match. Returns the netted regular items and any orphaned discounts that could not be matched. Fixes the case where a coupon references a parent by a partial description token (e.g. `/AAA BATTERY`) that does not exactly match the parent's full description (e.g. `AA/AAA BATTERY`).

[0.3.9]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.8...v0.3.9

## [0.3.8] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **`costco-cli -cmd import-token`**: New CLI command to bootstrap authentication by pasting the JSON response from the Costco token endpoint. Eliminates the need to manually edit `~/.costco/tokens.json`. See README for instructions.
- **`ImportTokenResponse()`**: New exported library function that converts a `TokenResponse` into `StoredTokens`, parsing the JWT expiry and calculating refresh token expiry from `refresh_token_expires_in`.

[0.3.8]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.7...v0.3.8

## [0.3.7] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **Version Drift**: Sync `constants.go` and `README.md` badge to `0.3.7` — both were missed during the `v0.3.6` re-tag and still reported `0.3.5`.
- **go.mod**: Promoted `golang.org/x/term` from indirect to direct dependency.

### Added
- **CI Version Gate**: New `version-consistency` CI job that fails if `constants.go`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the `README.md` badge don't all report the same version, preventing this class of drift in the future.

[0.3.7]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.6...v0.3.7

## [0.3.6] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **Module Checksum**: Re-tagged to resolve a `go.sum` checksum mismatch caused by a force-push to the `v0.3.5` tag. No code changes from v0.3.5.

[0.3.6]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.5...v0.3.6

## [0.3.5] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Token Refresh Authentication**: Updated Azure AD B2C policy version from `184` to `201` to match Costco's current authentication policy. This fixes token refresh failures that occurred after Costco updated their authentication infrastructure.

[0.3.5]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.3...v0.3.5

## [0.3.3] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed
- **Token Refresh Authentication**: Updated Azure AD B2C policy version from `157` to `184` to match Costco's current authentication policy. This fixes token refresh failures that occurred after Costco updated their authentication infrastructure.

[0.3.3]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.2...v0.3.3

## [0.3.2] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Significantly increased test coverage from 62.8% to 82.8%
  - Added integration tests for analytics functions (`GetItemHistory`, `GetSpendingSummary`, `GetFrequentItems`) - now calling actual client methods instead of testing logic inline
  - Added comprehensive tests for config persistence functions (`SaveConfig`, `LoadConfig`, `SaveTokens`, `LoadTokens`, `ClearTokens`, `GetConfigInfo`)
  - New test file `config_persistence_test.go` with 11 test cases covering config file operations, token management, and edge cases
  - Tests now cover file permissions, JSON validation, non-existent files, and expired tokens

### Changed
- **Improved Test Quality**: Rewrote existing analytics tests to call actual client methods, ensuring real-world usage patterns are tested

[0.3.2]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.1...v0.3.2

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-24

### Fixed
- **GetParentItemNumber() Whitespace Handling**: Fixed bug where `GetParentItemNumber()` returned item numbers with leading/trailing whitespace when Costco's API includes spaces after the slash (e.g., "/ 1857091"). The method now trims whitespace, making item numbers usable for direct lookups without additional processing by consumers.

### Added
- Test coverage for discount items with whitespace variations in descriptions

[0.3.1]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- **Discount Line Item Helpers**: Added helper methods to identify and process discount line items in receipts
  - `ReceiptItem.IsDiscount()` - Returns true if the item is a discount/adjustment line item
  - `ReceiptItem.GetParentItemNumber()` - Returns the item number the discount applies to
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added "Handling Discount Line Items" section to README with:
  - Explanation of discount item characteristics
  - Distinction between discounts and returns
  - Real-world examples and use cases
  - Code examples for calculating net item amounts
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for discount helpers including:
  - Edge case testing (returns, empty descriptions, slash in middle of string)
  - Real-world data from actual Costco receipts
  - Workflow tests demonstrating practical usage patterns

### Fixed
- Clarified that discount amounts are already factored into receipt subtotals to prevent double-counting in consuming applications

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/eshaffer321/costco-go/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **New Named Types**: Replaced anonymous struct return types with proper named types for better usability:
  - `ItemPurchase` - for `GetItemHistory()` results
  - `SpendingByDepartment` - for `GetSpendingSummary()` results
  - `FrequentItem` - for `GetFrequentItems()` results
- **Client Interface**: Added `CostcoClient` interface for better testability and mocking support
- **Comprehensive Godoc**: Added detailed documentation to all exported types and functions with examples
- **Domain-Specific Files**: Organized types into logical domain files:
  - `orders.go` - Order-related types
  - `receipts.go` - Receipt-related types
  - `analytics.go` - Analytics types
  - `options.go` - Configuration types
  - `graphql.go` - GraphQL types
  - `interface.go` - Client interface definition
- **Migration Guide**: Added `MIGRATION_v0.2.0.md` with comprehensive upgrade instructions for AI agents
- **Audit Documentation**: Added `AUDIT.md` with detailed codebase analysis and recommendations

### Changed
- **Breaking**: `GetItemHistory()` now returns `[]ItemPurchase` instead of anonymous struct
- **Breaking**: `GetSpendingSummary()` now returns `map[int]SpendingByDepartment` instead of anonymous struct
- **Breaking**: `GetFrequentItems()` now returns `[]FrequentItem` instead of anonymous struct
- **File Organization**: Split `types.go` into domain-specific files for better code organization
- **Performance**: Replaced O(n²) bubble sort with O(n log n) stdlib `sort.Slice` in `GetFrequentItems()`
- **Code Quality**: Removed duplicate type definitions between files

### Removed
- **Breaking**: Removed `types.go` (types moved to domain-specific files)
- Removed duplicate `TransactionWithItems` definition from `helpers.go` (now only in `analytics.go`)

### Improved
- Better code organization with clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced discoverability with logical type grouping
- Improved testability with interface-based design
- Better IDE autocomplete and documentation support
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase structure

### Migration Notes
See `MIGRATION_v0.2.0.md` for detailed upgrade instructions. Key changes:
- Update code using `GetItemHistory()`, `GetSpendingSummary()`, or `GetFrequentItems()` to use new named types
- No changes needed for core API methods (`GetOnlineOrders`, `GetReceipts`, `GetReceiptDetail`)
- Import path remains the same: `github.com/costco-go/pkg/costco`
